### Hi there, I am sinlerdev ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer and game developer with 4+ years of experience. I primarly use Roblox for my stuff, but I am looking to expand and use Godot for 2D games.

### My work
I am currently working on a few libraries to ship to the Roblox ecosystem under Plethan's domain which is my little company. The libraries are named Magma and Ultra, which the first is a reactive state management system and the latter a plugin framework with a UI view library.

### My workflow and tech stack
I use both rojo and studio workflows when I find them neccessery. I use rojo for advanced projects that I would like to have a proper contribution support, and studio workflow for projects that are easy to manage using studio natively.

I use luau and studio to develop my games, and node.js & typescript to code my other unrelated stuff.

### Learning
I am currently learning GDScript and Godot so I can expand my game development skill set with an engine that works different than the Roblox engine.

### Collaboration
Sometimes, I collaborate on projects that I am personally interested in.
