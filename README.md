### Hi there, I am sinlerdev ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer and game developer with 4+ years of experience. I primarly use Roblox for my stuff, but I am looking to expand and use Godot for 2D games.

### My Work

I have worked on multiple open source libraries for Roblox community, the most famous are:
1. BoxCast - A fast solution for casting boxes. Archived, but still works well.
2. Vinum - a modern solution for reactive state management.
3. Delver - soon to be released
4. ShapeCast - soon to be released
5. Atticus - a modern solution for sword creation, very soon to be released.

### Learning
